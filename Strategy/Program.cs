/*
 *  Summary:
 *      The strategy pattern is a behavioral software design strategy that 
 *      allows an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. 
 *      The pattern encapsulates each algorithm and makes the algorithm
 *      interchangeable. This pattern promotes the Open/Closed principle
 *      by using composition over inheritance.
 *      
 *  Problem:
 *      
 *  Solution:
 *      The strategy pattern simplifies and accelerates development by 
 *      outsourcing complex algorithms to separate classes. This can be 
 *      demonstrated by using the strategy pattern to encapsulate 
 *      different sorting algorithms.
 *      
 *  Add the following classes:    
 *      1. ISortStrategy
